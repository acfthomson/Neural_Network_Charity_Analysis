# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
Fictional company Alphabet Soup requested a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether organizations will be successful if Alphabet Soup provides them funding.  Alphabet Soup provided a dataset that contained more than 34,000 organizations that received funding from them.  This dataset captured the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

A neural network model was created to determine if an organization would be successful or not if Alphabet Soup provided them funding.
